        "# Python OOPs Questions\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "   - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects” that contain data (attributes) and methods (functions) to operate on that data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "   - A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "   - An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with state (data) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "   - **Abstraction**: Hides implementation details, shows only essential features.\n",
        "   - **Encapsulation**: Bundles data and methods into a single unit and restricts direct access to data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?*italicised text*\n",
        "   - Dunder (double underscore) methods like __init__, __str__, __len__ are special methods that allow customization of class behavior.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "   - Inheritance allows one class (child) to acquire attributes and methods of another class (parent). Promotes reusability.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows the same function or operator to behave differently based on the object (e.g., * works for numbers and strings).\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "   - Encapsulation is achieved by defining private (__var) and protected (_var) attributes and controlling access via methods.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "   - A constructor is the __init__ method, automatically called when an object is created to initialize attributes.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "    - **Class method:** Defined with @classmethod, takes cls as parameter, works with class-level data.\n",
        "    - **Static method:** Defined with @staticmethod, does not take self or cls, works like a normal function inside a class.\n",
        "11.  What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "     - Python does not support traditional overloading. It can be simulated using default arguments or *args, **kwargs.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "    - When a child class defines a method with the same name as in the parent class, it replaces the parent’s implementation.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "    - @property allows defining getter/setter methods in a class while accessing them like attributes.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "     - It increases flexibility and reusability by allowing the same interface to be used for different types of objects.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "    - An abstract class (defined with abc module) contains abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "    - Reusability\n",
        "    - Modularity\n",
        "    - Extensibility\n",
        "    - Abstraction\n",
        "    - Maintainability\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "    - Class variable: Shared across all instances.\n",
        "    - Instance variable: Unique to each object.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "    - A class can inherit from multiple parent classes, allowing it to combine behaviors.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in PythonH\n",
        "    - __str__: Defines human-readable string (used with print).\n",
        "    - __repr__: Defines developer-friendly string (used in debugging, repr()).\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "    - super() is used to call methods of the parent class inside a child class.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "    - Destructor method, called when an object is about to be destroyed (used for cleanup).\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "    - @staticmethod: No self or cls, acts like a normal function.\n",
        "    - @classmethod: Takes cls, modifies class-level data.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "    - A parent method can be overridden in a child class, and based on the object type, the correct method is called.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "     - Method chaining allows calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line (by returning self in methods).\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "    - Makes an object callable like a function (e.g., obj() will invoke obj.__call__()).\n"
